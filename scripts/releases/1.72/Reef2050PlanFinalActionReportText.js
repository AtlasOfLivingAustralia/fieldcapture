        "\r\n\r\nIn light of the impacts to the Reef from the coral bleaching and the extreme weather events of 2018 and 2019, the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Forum brought forward the scheduled mid-term review of the Reef 2050 Plan to ensure it addresses current " +
        "pressures and remains effective. An updated Reef 2050 Plan was released in July 2020 as a result of this mid-term review." +
        "\r\n\r\nA number of changes were made to the Reef 2050 Plan actions including revision, removal and the addition of new actions. Due to these changes, additional detailed action reporting for the period January to June 2021 has not been undertaken." +
        " \r\n\r\nThe Reef 2050 Plan action tracker shows the status (as at July 2020) and treatment of all original Reef 2050 Plan actions through the mid-term review. " +
        "The action tracker is available at:" +

        "\r\n\r\nDelivering the mid-term review of the Reef 2050 Plan was a key focus during the period January to June 2020. Other key achievements include:" +
        "\r\n\r\n* Increased protection for high-value regrowth and remnant vegetation and boosted protection of important habitats, including waterways leading to the Great Barrier Reef, through passage of new " +
        "vegetation management laws by the Queensland Parliament. " +
        "\r\n\r\n* Traditional Owners from across the Reef came together at a workshop to share their insights, advice and aspirations for the Reef, and provide advice on the future roles they want to play" +
        " in protecting the Reef and their culture. Through this workshop Traditional Owners also provided advice to inform the program design of the Reef 2050 Integrated Reporting and Monitoring Program." +
        "\r\n\r\n* Increased support for implementation of the Reef 2050 Plan through additional funding commitments from the Australian and Queensland Governments. The funding will contribute to:\r\n   " +
        " * preventing soil, pesticides and nitrogen run off from damaging the Reef; \r\n    * strengthening on-water compliance and marine park management; \r\n    * increasing crown-of-thorns starfish control;" +
        " \r\n    * harnessing the best science to implement reef restoration and support Reef resilience and adaptation; \r\n    * reef integrated monitoring and reporting activities; and\r\n  " +
        "  * strengthening Traditional Owner and community engagement in protection of the Reef.\r\n\r\nThe next Reef 2050 Plan action report will report on progress against " +
        "the revised Reef 2050 Plan actions for the period July 2020 to June 2021. \r\n",
